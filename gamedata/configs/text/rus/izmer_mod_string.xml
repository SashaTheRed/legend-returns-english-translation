		<text>Rough artisanal modification of the radiometer "Pripyat" RKS-20.03, created by an unknown craftsman to work in the conditions of modern Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.  Distributed semi-legally in small batches. It is an essential attribute of almost any novice explorer in the Zone. The device is able to detect some anomalies, as well as radiation pockets, producing characteristic sounds. The device is able to determine the presence of active radionuclides in the body, but because of malfunctions it can not show the exact radiation dose.</text>

	<string id="st_radiacion_izmer_2_em_descr">
		<text>The IDS is an advanced and quite common device among stalkers. It measures the equivalent dose of ionizing radiation in the body of the carrier. Despite its advantages, it has a number of shortcomings, among which are malfunctions and possible inaccuracies in measurements. Shows only the approximate level of contamination.</text>

	<string id="st_radiacion_izmer_3_em_descr">
		<text>"Pripyat-9" is designed specifically to work in the conditions of the modern Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The installation of special filters allows the device to "bypass" the radiation from the abnormal environment, thereby eliminating all possible errors. It's able to measure the levels of radioactive contamination in the user's body and show the result with extreme accuracy.</text>
