	<string id="ecolog_find_artefact_3_text">
		<text>Our research team is on the brink of discovering the mystery of space-time. The possibility of teleportation is no longer fantasy! The Vortex is an anomaly which squeezes space rather than just gravitationally affecting objects, as believe some of my ossified opponents-theorists, who sit in the warm research facility earnestly chewing chalk. Their glasses will fog up when they find out what results science can achieve when you work in the field! Please get me the Jellyfish artifact.</text>

		<text>We got acquainted with Semenov back in the university where I was giving lectures on genetics, and he was my student. Thus I became his scientific chief. Back then, we were only slightly unveiling the curtain of mystery of genome modification. So what was I saying? Oh, right. For genetic experiments we will need the samples of fresh cells of the muscular tissue of snork. You will have to search the bogs for this genic material. There is a hypothesis that snorks as species are the new level of human's evolution. In order to know this for sure, DNA test must be procured!</text>

		<text>Good news, young man: we have a very interesting assignment for you! I think as an intellectual being with quite a bit of experience you will be able to appreciate my colleagues' theories. The thing is, our research revealed: the eyes of the creatures called flesh in the common language, are equipped with... are you following me?... with olfactory receptors! Thus, they can not only see with their eyes, but smell with them as well! We're getting ready for an operation on transplanting this miraculous eye to one of ... one of our voluntary assistants. I believe we're about to start a craze! By the way, would you like to become a recipient of this rather amazing organ?</text>
