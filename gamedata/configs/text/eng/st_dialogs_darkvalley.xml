		<text>We watch over stalkers. You have to admit that a good half of you are more like little kids than men. You come to the Zone with some silly dreams, or to play heroes, or just because life's treating you badly. You don't realize all that's waiting for you in here -  the grim reaper, mostly. That's the kind we look after. We find one at the Garbage, we take his gear and send 'im back to the Cordon. Some wise up and go back to the outside. Those with the stones to come back here, we put under our protection and we tax 'em. I'm tellin' ya, no one dares go on our territory - not the army, not the mercenaries, not even mutants.</text>

		<text>Our legs. We came here for stalkers, what else? Without us around to keep order it's sheer god-damn chaos. You loot it, you keep it, sure, but who's gonna pay your taxes? You know, the peace and security tax. Like if one of youse is milking an anomaly while we're on the lookout, keeping mutants at bay. If he comes out fine, we take a cut... for maintaining order, you understand.</text>

		<text>How did you become boss?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b7_bandit_boss_sultan_about_11131">
		<text>Where do I begin... I guess it goes back to high school. I had a good buddy, a best friend, if you will. We hung out together, smoking, drinking and whatnot. Only he wanted more and more thrills. He got into drugs: some weed at first, then smack and then coke, when he started getting some coin. I told him, "You gotta get off this shit, Tolyan, before it's too late." But he didn't listen. He scored some bad shit one day and that was that. I found his dealers and got even for my buddy... Got my picture took and all hell broke loose - the slammer, the gang fights, the shiv in the belly... Got out, started a business, got busted again... When I got out again, I left all that shit behind and set my sights on the Zone. Spent a couple months toughing it out, then got promoted. So now I'm in charge here, upholding the local law.</text>

		<text>What do you think about stalkers?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zat_b7_bandit_boss_sultan_about_11141">
		<text>They're all different, like. Some are punks who don't last here a week, others are earners... and others still are okay guys that life has kicked around on both sides of the Cordon. We fleece the first kind, tax the second kind. As far as the last kind, well, we just try not to get in each other's way. Too bad you can't always tell them apart right away...</text>

		<text>What's the story, Olivius?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="kill_fanatic_quest_dialog_1">
		<text>"Heh-heh, listen, kiddo. A story from my life. When I just came to the Zone, I was a stalker, and I knew a kid - He was called Fanatic. I worked together with him with a stalker taskmaster - Valerian. Except that I've always been drawn to the thieving life... So, this bastard found out that I wanted to go to work with the bandits, and decided to "teach" me. When I was repairing something, he threw a grenade in the hangar, right in the cabin. And since there were few people back then, I realized that he wanted the others to think that I did it on myself, probably by accident. I got out of there, but the explosion caught me anyway. And that's the reason why i I have a scar on the entire left leg. In short, you can easily understand that I want to take revenge on him."</text>

	<string id="kill_fanatic_quest_dialog_2">
		<text>If he hits me, I can put a bullet in his forehead.</text>

	<string id="kill_fanatic_quest_dialog_3">

		<text>Yes you can. One goldfinch wound up in the Cordon, people call him Wolf. He organizes attacks on our camps, and seriously interferes with my business. You have to take him out.</text>

	<string id="sultan_task1_begin_2">
